## Process improvement
This document describes how to improve the process itself. Such changes can be everything from changing an existing description (to clarify something or correcting faults) to adding complete new processe descriptions.

The step by step description for making a change is as follow:
1. Create a change request in Github by using the 'Process Change Request' template.
2. The change request should be assigned to the Process Owner
3. The Process Owner should clarify the change request with the creator if there are any ambiguities.
4. The Process Owner either approve or reject the change. If the change request is rejected the issue is closed with a motivation.
5. If approved the Process Owner need to assign the issue to a person that should do the change.
6. The changes should be done in a separate branch to avoid changes to the master branch before changes are reviewed.
7. When the assignee is done with the changes a pull request should be created with the 'process-pull-request' template and then assigned it to the Process Owner.
8. When the changes has been accpeted by the Process Owner it can be merged to the master branch and a new version of the process is created.
